It also offers an updated implementation of the original Mass Spectrometry File Converter, replacing its former [Common Workflow Language (CWL)](https://www.commonwl.org/) - based architecture with a cleaner, modular system based on individual microservices managed by a centralized controller. It includes detailed setup instructions for running locally, deploying via Docker, and managing Kubernetes installations—covering both manual and Helm chart-based configurations for scalability.
