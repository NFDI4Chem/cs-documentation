The converter service on this section is built on the [Common Workflow Language (CWL)](https://www.commonwl.org/) , selected for its exceptional interoperability, portability, and reproducibility. The source code is housed in a GitLab repository, complete with a CI/CD pipeline that not only automates the generation of conversion and validation summary reports but also fosters community collaboration. These reports offer a detailed overview of the conversion and validation process, ensuring transparency and efficiency across various file formats.
