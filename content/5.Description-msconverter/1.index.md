# Options on API of MS File Converter

## 1. msconvert:Conversion
- It employs the msconvert command from ProteoWizard to convert files into various formats, with a primary focus on generating mzML output.
- [Additional options supported by msconvert](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/tools/msconvert.html) can be specified in the `parameter` section, as illustrated in the figure below.
- It accepts `.RAW` files directly, while `.wiff` and `.wiff.scan` has to be compressed as `.tar` before input.The same requirement applies to folders with `.D` extensions.

## 2.Fileinfo:Validation
- It employs the FileInfo command from OpenMS to validate mzML files, as described [here](https://openms.de/documentation/html/TOPP_FileInfo.html).

## 3. FileConvert:Conversion
- It leverages [OpenMS’s FileConvert tool](https://openms.de/documentation/TOPP_FileConverter.html) to transform data from external sources into formats compatible with OpenMS/TOPP.

## 4. FileMetadata:MetadataExtraction
- It extracts header-level metadata — along with optional spectra and chromatogram summaries — from any mzML file (Proteomics Standards Initiative format) and outputs the results as JSON or JSON Lines, following the [mzML schema](https://sbeams.systemsbiology.net/tmp/mzML1.0.0.html).
