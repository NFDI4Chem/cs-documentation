It includes detailed setup instructions for running locally, deploying via Docker, and managing Kubernetes installations—covering both manual and Helm chart-based configurations for scalability. The system notably replaces traditional shared drives with S3 object storage, utilizing multi-part upload to stream large files in customizable chunks that are reassembled upon completion. This architecture ensures resilient, high-performance processing, as each chunk uploads independently—allowing parallel transfers and isolated retries without restarting the entire file transfer."]],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":1,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"description":"Docker Based Mass Spectrometry File Converter.","extension":"md","links":null,"meta":{},"navigation":{"icon":"i-lucide-house"},"path":"/msconverter-s3-enabled","seo":{"title":"Introduction","description":"Docker Based Mass Spectrometry File Converter."},"stem":"4.msconverter-s3-enabled/1.index","__hash__":"SYHD1H9_nxl4G5Vrar1eXo6b5-pjX8ps4M5j7mvN3R8"}
