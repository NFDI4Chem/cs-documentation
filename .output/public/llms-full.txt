# Introduction

The integration of the latest machines and technologies, combined with a diverse array of existing systems, expands the range of data formats and types, thereby introducing new challenges. To effectively navigate these complexities, it is crucial to implement robust governance mechanisms that ensure seamless conversion of diverse data formats into standardized forms.

The repository includes all the necessary code to run a converter, which is built on Flask, adheres to the OpenAPI specification (API Flask Module ), and provides a REST API for seamless integration with other NFDI4Chem services. The entire system is also packaged in a Docker image for easy deployment, and with a Helm chart available to streamline deployment in Kubernetes environments.

This repository is specifically designed to facilitate the conversion of mass spectrometry files from various formats into the mzML format.
