It includes detailed setup instructions for running locally, deploying via Docker, and managing Kubernetes installations—covering both manual and Helm chart-based configurations for scalability. The system notably replaces traditional shared drives with S3 object storage, utilizing multi-part upload to stream large files in customizable chunks that are reassembled upon completion. This architecture ensures resilient, high-performance processing, as each chunk uploads independently—allowing parallel transfers and isolated retries without restarting the entire file transfer.",{"title":60,"searchDepth":61,"depth":62,"links":63},"",1,2,[],"Docker Based Mass Spectrometry File Converter.","md",null,{},{"icon":11},{"title":10,"description":64},"SYHD1H9_nxl4G5Vrar1eXo6b5-pjX8ps4M5j7mvN3R8",[72,74],{"title":20,"path":31,"stem":32,"description":73,"icon":23,"children":-1},"Docker Based Mass Spectometry File Coverter.",{"title":20,"path":40,"stem":41,"description":75,"icon":23,"children":-1},"Mass Spectrometry File Converter.",1763153939403]
